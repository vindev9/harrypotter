                        <p>Harry Potter is a wizard, the only child of James and Lily Potter. He is famous for having survived an attack by Lord Voldemort when he was a baby. He is also sometimes known as ‘The Boy Who Lived’. For the first eleven years of his life Harry lives with his mean aunt and uncle and is unaware of his wizarding roots. It is only on his eleventh birthday that he finds out he is a wizard and is invited to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. At Hogwarts Harry is in the house of Gryffindor.</p>

                                <p>He was the oldest son of Kendra and Percival and older brother to Aberforth and Ariana. He was known as one of the most talented and brilliant wizards in the wizarding world and his achievements (including the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood) seemed to be endless. Although, he almost strayed off this path as a young man to go down a much darker road. He became the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.</p><br>

                                <p>Tom Marvolo Riddle (31 December 1926 – 2 May 1998), later known as Lord Voldemort or, alternatively as You-Know-Who, the Dark Lord, or He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was an English half-blood wizard considered to have been the most powerful and dangerous Dark Wizard of all time. He was amongst the greatest wizards to have ever lived, often considered more powerful or equal to Albus Dumbledore. The only child and son of Tom and Merope Riddle (née Gaunt), Riddle was raised in the Muggle-run Wool's Orphanage after his father abandoned his new family on the streets of London when the influence of her magic was lifted, and his mother died moments after giving birth to and naming him after his father and maternal grandfather, Marvolo Gaunt.</p>
